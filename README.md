Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
There were 525 successful theater Kickstarters in the US.
We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart.
The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.
The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.
Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals.
